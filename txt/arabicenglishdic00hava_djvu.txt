PREFACE 

The  aim  of  the  Directors  of  the  Catholic  Press,  in  publi- 
shing the  present  work,  has  been  to  meet  the  want  of  a 
classical  Arabic-English  Dictionary,  which  while  compre- 
hensive, yet  might  be  handy  and  cheap  enough  for  practical 
use  amongst  the  students  desirous  of  acquiring  a  thorough 
knowledge  of  Arabic  literature  and  poetry. 

Of  the  many  Arabic-English  Dictionaries  existing  up  to 
this  time,  those  published  in  England  are  too  expensive  for 
ordinary  students,  while  those  that  may  be  found  in 
Syria  and  Egypt  are  by  no  means  adequate  to  any  serious 
purpose,  as  they  only  contain  a  list  of  the  principal  words, 
with  none  of  those  turns  and  expressions  that  give  so  peculiar 
a  feature  to  Arabic,  and  into  which  as  in  a  mould  the 
language   has  been  cast. 

This  Dictionary  is  an  attempt  to  supply  those  deficien- 
cies. Without  jDretending  xo  being  exhaustive,  yet  it  is 
comprehensive  enough  to  enable  the  students  to  read  the 
chief  works  of  literature  and  poetry. 

The  author  has  followed  in  his  translation  the  standard 
work  of  M^  Lane,  as  it  is  by  far  the  best  work  ever  published 
in  this  line.  But  as  the  celebrated  Lexicon  is  only  parachie- 
ved  as  far  as  the  letter  ^},  and  as  it  does  not  comprehend 
all  the  roots,  it  has  been  necessary  to  go  back  to  the  ori- 
ginal Arabic  sources. 

The  work  has  been  compiled  on  the  same  principles 
as  F^.  Belot's  Arabic-French  Dictionary  which  has  been  so 
favorably  received  in  almost  every  school  and  has  reached 
within  a  short  time  its  fifth  edition.  The  English  equivalent 
has  been  slightly  increased  in  size  so  as  to  include  many 
new  words  and  expressions  without  becoming  too  bulky. 

Moreover  the  author  has  taken  particular  care  to  trans- 
late accurately  scientific  terms  and  especially  botanical 
names,  which  are  ordinarily  rendered  in  a  general  sense 
by  words  such  as  these  "species  of  plant".  This  is  a  pecu- 
liar feature  of  this  new  Dictionary  for  which  the  celebrated 
work  of  Ibn  Bithar  the  Arab  Botanist  has  been  consulted, 
as  well  as  the  modern  WT)rk  of  Forskal. 

The  vulgar  tongue  of  Syria  and  Egypt  is  largely  repre- 
sented with  peculiar  signs  and  the  personal  experience  of 
the  author  has  enabled  him  to  add  many  words  and  to 
correct  some    inaccurate  renderings. 

An  appendix  to  the  Dictionary  gives  in  the  original  language 
the  etymology  of  Arabic  words  derived  from  foreign  sources. 


VI 

EXPLANATORY  REMARKS. 

ORDER  OF  WORDS. 

1°  The  order  followed  in  the  Dictionary  is  the  same  as  is  gene- 
rally adopted  by  European  Orientalists,  viz.  the  radical  roots,  marked 
thus  {^)  are  given  in  alphabetical  order,  each  one  followed  by  all  the 
derivative  forms. 

2°  The  foreign  words  introduced  into  Arabic,  although  they  do 
not  beiong  to  any  radical,  have  been  assimilated  to  Arabic  words, 
being  considered  as  arabicised  and  as  such  connected  with  a  radical 
really  existing  or  supposed,  so  that  they  are  to  be  searched  in  the 
Dictionary  without  taking  into  account  the  augmentative  letters  inclu- 
ded in  the  paradigm  jj^JL  ,  exactly  as  would  be  done  for  Arabic 
words. 

For  instance   JjJs^\   is  to  be   found  in  the  root  Jj    (paradigm 

(J«*^l),  j\j\  in  J  J: ,  j^  in^&gt;  0_rl-^  in  f^.  &gt;  J^^  ^^J^i  J:!^^  in  Jf  ^^c. 

j*^  Whenever  a  o  occurs  in  the  second  letter  of  a  quadriliteral 
noun  or  verb,  it  is  to  be  referred  to  the  triliteral  root,  the  letter  o 
being  then  augmentative  ;  thus  ijlj-  is  to  be  found  in  jic  ,  o^^SS  in 
^Ss.  ,  jj-Ct  in  ,_^~ji  ,  ^.Jvi  in  jji-  ,  ^j-x.^  in  ^j-J*  ,  and  so  on.  The 
reason  lies  in  this,  that  this  letter  is  added  to  give  an  intensive  form 
to  the  original  meaning  of  the  triliteral  form,  and  this  kind  of  words 
has  been  so  classed  in  the  Arabic  Lexicons.  But  when  o  is  considered 
as  radical,  they  are  left  in  the  ordinary  alphabetical  order.  Even  as 
a  rule  we  repeat  them  in  order  to  save  too  much  trouble  to  the  stu- 
dents. 

4*^  Quasi-quadriliteral  forms  having  a  j  or  tj  in  the  second  or  third 
letter  are  to  be  found  in  the  corresponding  triliteral  form,  to  which  they 
are  supposed  to  belong,  ^  in,  ^,  ^_j=-  in  ^^,  jj^,  in  j_x 

5*^  Reduplicative  verbs  such  as^^  ,  JJj  always  follow  the  bili- 
teral  verb  to  which  they  correspond  ,  J&gt;^  to  ^  ,   JJj  to  l)j  ;   and 


VII 


they  are  placed  in  the  same  order  even  if  the   biiiteral   root  is   wan- 
ting ;  thus  ^jcj  is  mentioned  immediately  after  'j»j  . 

6^    Quadriliteral  words  beginning  by  is  are  to   be  referred  to  a 
triliteral  noun,  as  j,*.^  to^a-  ,  f-y^^  to  »jj,  fr_^_   to  «J  ,    jl^.  to  J^. 


ETYMOLOGY. 

We  give  in  an  appendix  a  list  of  Arabic  words  derived  from  fo- 
reign languages.  Those  borrowed  from  Turkish  or  Persian,  are  mentio- 
ned only  when  they  have  undergone  a  change  in  the  Arabic  trans- 
cription. For  the  others  the  orthography  being  the  same,  there  is  no 
need  of  repeating  them.  We  refer  these  words  to  their  primitive 
origin,  although  the  foreign  words  used  in  common  language  may  be 
said  almost  without  exception  to  belong  to  Turkish,  and  have  been  intro- 
duced through  its  medium  ;  as  ^■&gt;J^-,  oX^J  ,  ^CjJL  ,  L Jj  j^\  ,  »j_^L-  ; 
and  especially  all  the  Persian  words  as  iiij  ,  i*ii.  ,  ±z, . 

We  give  the  etymology  of  the  words  as  they  are  to  be  found,  in 
Arabic,  Persian,  or  Turkish  Lexicons,  such  as  Lane,  Freytag,  Dozy, 
Barbier  de  Mesnard,  Meninski  etc ;  but  we  cannot  vouch  for  the 
accuracy  of  al) ,  as  some  of  them  are  obviously  doubtful,  especially 
some  Persian  words,  the  etymology  of  which  is  variously  explained. 
In  that  case  we  quote  the  form  that  appeared  to  us  more  consistent 
with  analogy.  The  words  derived  from  Coptic  are  not  included  in  the 
list  ;  they  are  very  few  and  they  chiefly  pertain  to  names  of  months, 
which  are  only  used  in  Egypt. 

We  have  added  an  errata  to  the  work,  in  order  to  correct  some 
typographical  faults,  especially  those  concerning  the  letters  indicating 
the  foreign  origin  of  the  words  ;   no  doubt,   other  misprints  may   be 


VIII 

found  in  the  Arabic  accents,  owing  to  the  minuteness  of  the  type, 
but  they  may  be  said  to  be  unavoidable  even  in  the  best  Lexicons  and 
can  be  easily  detected  by  the  reader.  Errare  humanum  est. 

I  wish,  at  the  end  of  this  work,  to  thank  all  those  who  have  had 
a  part  in  so  arduous  an  undertaking,  especially  F^'  Belot  author  of 
the  Arabic-French  Dictionary,  whose  assistance  has  been  precious 
to  me,  as  well  as  F^"  Louis  Cheikho  who  has  given  me  some  very 
useful  advices  and  generally  all  those  who  had  a  share  in  the  collation 
of  the  proofs. 


CONVENTIONAL  SIGNS. 


-ft-    Indication  of  a  new  Arabic  root. 
-^   Used  in  the  dialect  of  Syria, 
a    In  that  of  Egypt. 

i'^  It  must  be  remarked  that  if  the  two  preceding  signs  are 
placed  before  an  Arabic  root,  it  means  that  the  Arabic  word  and  its 
meaning  pertain  to  that  dialect ;  if  placed  before  the  English  sense,  it 
affects  only  the  special  meaning  given,  the  word  being  good  Arabic 
in  its  form. 

2^  It  must  be  noted  that  most  of  the  vulgar  meanings  marked 
with  the  sign  &lt;&gt;■  are  common  to  both  dialects,  while  those  marked  a  are 
only  used  in  Egypt. 

( — )    in  the  beginnmg  of  a  line,  stands  for  the  repetition  of  the  prece- 
ding word. : 

E.  g.  5u-&gt; 

*j  5  iJ  -  Stands  for    a  j  »  i  ji&gt; 


IX 

(  J  )    A  comma  intervening   between  nouns  or  verbs   following  in  a 
sequel ,  indicates  a  newform  having  the  same  meaning  as  the  former  e.  g. 

means  that  o  Li.  L^^  is  the  plural  of  oLa.  and  that  i-^^^-l  is  a  new  form 
in  the   singular  retaining  the  same  meaning  as  oU. 

means  that  ( a  ^-j&gt;^  )  is  another  form  of  the  same  verb  having  the  same 
meaning  as  ( i  j,^-^  ) 

(•)    A  semicolon  is  put  for  distinguishing  words  that  have  a  common 
meaning,  without  being  synonymous. 

( : )    A  colon  placed  between  two  nouns  separates  the  object  from  the 
subject  of  a  verb. 

E.  g.    To  blast  (the  plants ;  hoar-frost)  f^  JtiLkl. 
To  miss  (the  butt :  shooter)  Ji-  \ 

(  )  The  words  included  in  a  parenthesis  are  either  given  as  an 
explanation,  or  to  complete  the  meaning  of  a  verb  or  noun,  which 
is  not  mentioned  explicitly  in  Arabic.  Thus  a  parenthesis  explains  the 
sense  understood  by   the  letters  a  or   »   in   Arabic. 

(  5  ,  *)     These  letters  show  a  verb  to  be  transitive ;  and  when  they 
are  wanting  the  verb  is  intransitive. 
*     stands  for  inanimate  things; 
-6     for  animate  beings. 

When  both  signs  are  found  together  without  being  separated  by  j 
they  mean  that  the  verb  has  a  double  object, 
a  i  o    following  an  Arabic  verb   show  that  the  aorist  has  its  second 


&gt;  &gt;'  ^     -  '  ^ 

j^  o 

Two  letters  following  the  same  verb  indicate  that  the  same  may 
have  two  forms,  as  :  i  o  Jji&gt;^  means  that   the  aorist  is  JXs^  or  J.ij^
